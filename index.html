	<h1> Justin Mireles</h1>

		<p> I am a 31 year old graphic design major and have been at ACC for three years. I, however, do not live in Austin, I live in a small town called Rockdale, about an hour away from here. I also work at Hobby Lobby in Round Rock, and have been there for the past five years.</p>

		<p>I have a 2 year old english bulldog named "Chancho". Some of my hobbies include watching a lot of movies, drawing, playing video games, and watching anime. To feed my nerd culture addiction, I also enjoy going to comic cons.</p>


	<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>

	<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>

		<p>It's very hard to pick a favorite movie for me, but I have a favorite movie for each genre. If I had to pick a favorite comedy movie, it would have to be <em>Tommy Boy</em> starring <strong>Chris Farley</strong> and <strong>David Spade</strong>. I probably watch that movie once a month.</p>
